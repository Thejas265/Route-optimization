# Route Optimization using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Introduction  
This project implements Route Optimization using Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path between cities. It models a road network as a graph where nodes represent cities, edges represent roads, and weights represent distances.  

##  How It Works  
Creates a graph-based city network
Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest route  
Visualizes the optimal path on a graph  

## Requirements  
Python. NetworkX (for graph modeling),Matplotlib (for visualization)  

## Example Output
